#URL Shortener Microservice

A full stack JavaScript app built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose, with Bootstrap for the (minimal!) front end, and Mocha for testing that fulfills the following user stories:

1. User Story: I can pass a URL as a parameter and I will receive a shortened URL in the JSON response.

2. User Story: If I pass an invalid URL that doesn't follow the valid http://www.example.com format, the JSON response will contain an error instead.

3. User Story: When I visit that shortened URL, it will redirect me to my original link.

Built for the URL Shortener Microservice API Project at Free Code Camp.

A running version of the app can be found at http://ecc-urlshortener-ms.herokuapp.com/
